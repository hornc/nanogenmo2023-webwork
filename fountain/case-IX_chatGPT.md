This final interaction brings Bob, Alice, and Clarise together in a unique and unexpected friendship forged through their diverse interests.

### Commentary
... It has done a good job coming up with a some story given really no input context. I'll probably need to add _something_ to set a scene or provide some specifc motivations. Keeler's more complex plot tend to involve passive characters, or "objects" in some of the roles which makes things more varied, and will be less about chat GPT's desires to see everyone come together at coffee shops and share interests.
